# Channel API

{{APPLICATION_NAME}} has a full channel API so you can build your own interface to add and map channels. Please ask us directly if you need.

* Add & Delete channels
* Read list of channels
* Channel settings and mappings

Each channel mapping is different so it will take developer time to build mapping for each OTA. We provide a[ iframe solution](channel-iframe.md) to make this simpler
